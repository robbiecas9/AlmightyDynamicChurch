0.0s

Our beliefs are based on Bible principles.

1\. Almighty God

Jehovah is the almighty God . Almighty" emphasizes God's omnipotence, His ultimate power and authority over all creation. He created everything. "Almighty God Jehovah" reflects the belief in God as the supreme ruler of the universe, the creator of all things, and the one who governs with justice, mercy, and love. It underscores and attribute to God's divine majesty and power, inviting them to worship Him with reverence and trust in His providence. All human beings need to worship and obey Jehovah God. The Lord our God is one. God is not trinity. We shall love God with all our heart and with all our soul and with all our might. He is a loving God .God wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. God listen and answer to our prayers.

(Gen 1:1,2:4, Psalms 83:18, Exodus 20:2,3 . Deuteronomy 6:4 )

2\. Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of Almighty God. He is God’s perfect son. In the greatest demonstration of love ever expressed, God allowed that perfect son to take our place on a cross. Jesus died for us and gave a provision for our salvation. He and He alone was qualified to pay the debt for our sin and He paid that debt in full. Jesus paid the penalty of our sin. And by faith and grace we can obtain salvation in Christ alone. Jesus willingly sacrificed himself to absolve humanity of sin, offering a path to reconciliation with God. Jesus is the sole mediator between God and man

( Mathew 3:16, John 3:16, 1 Timithy 2:5,6)

3\. Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is the active force of Almighty God. Holy Spirit is not a person, it is the power Almighty God . God uses holy spirit ,the power, to accomplish his purposes. Holy Spirit is God's active presence in the world, guiding, comforting, and empowering believers. Holy Spirit inspired God’s servants to write the Holy scriptures, the Bible. Holy spirit console, strengthen and help to understand deep knowledge about God’s word. Holy Spirit leading them to deeper understanding of God's will and empowering them to live up to God’s standards.

(Genesis 1:2, Mathew 1:20. Acts 2:4,33. Acts 10:44-47)

4\. The Bible

All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right. Our worship and beliefs are based on Bible principles. Meditating on the Bible is a wonderful invitation from God that not only encourages our hearts each day, but transforms us to live according to Bible principles. The Bible instructs us with regard to worship, prayer, organizing churches, witnessing and much more. We must study the Bible daily to know how to live in this world, how to relate to God and to one another.

(2 Timothy 3:16,17. Psalms 119:105. John 17:17))

5\. Worship

Worshipping the Almighty God through Jesus is a profound act of faith and devotion. We should worship Him in “spirit and in truth”. This is not a suggestion, but a command. We do not need large buildings or elaborate ceremonies to do this. We can do this with an truthful and honest heart. Worshipping Almighty God through Jesus acknowledges his central role in our salvation and redemption, recognizing him as the ultimate expression of God's presence and power in our lives. May our worship be a testament to our faith, a source of strength and inspiration. No Idols or images should be used for worshipping Almighty God.

(Exodus 20:2,3 . Isaiah 42:8. Mathew 4:10. John 4:24)

6\. Salvation

Salvation is not earned through good deeds or personal merit but is received as a free gift of God's grace, through faith in Jesus Christ. Believers need to confess their sins, repent, and place their trust in Jesus as their Lord and Savior, thereby receiving the gift of eternal life and a renewed relationship with God. Through Jesus, we can find forgiveness and the assurance of God's unfailing love, inviting all to experience the transformative power of salvation. The Son of God, willingly sacrificed himself on the cross, taking upon himself the sins of humanity and offering salvation to all who believe in him. Salvation through Jesus Christ is the profound message of redemption and reconciliation between humanity and God.

( John 3:16,36. Ephesians 2:8-10. Galatians 2:20. 1 Timothy 2:5,6)

7\. Our Hope -Everlasting life in God’s Kingdom

The hope of eternal life in God’s kingdom is a profound source of comfort, strength, and inspiration. We are assured that death is not the end but a gateway to a new and eternal life in communion with our Creator. This hope empowers us to face life's challenges with courage and resilience, knowing that our ultimate destiny is secure in the hands of a loving and faithful God. It reminds us to live with purpose and intentionality, investing our time, talents, and resources in pursuits that align with God's kingdom and bring glory to His name. In times of uncertainty, hardship, and grief, the hope of eternal life serves as an anchor for our souls, grounding us in the unchanging truth of God's promises.

( John 17:3. Mathew 6:10 , Psalms 37:29 , Revelation 21:3,4 )

8.Baptism

Water baptism is something we encourage for every believer in Christ to experience. Water baptism is an outward declaration that the one being baptized has made a complete, unconditional dedication through Lord Jesus Christ to do the will of Almighty God. We are declaring that we who were once dead because of our sin are now alive in Christ, completely forgiven of our sins and made righteous before God .Christian Baptism is a sacred and joyous occasion, celebrating the grace of God and the transformative power of faith in Jesus Christ.

(Mathew 28:19,20 . Acts 2:38. John 3:5. Colossians 2:12)

9\. Preaching Work

Jesus told us to teach people to obey everything he had commanded us. We should have a sense of responsibility to preach the good news of the kingdom to all the world, making disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The end of this systems of things is fast approaching. We need to proclaim the good news to save people from the great destruction. God’s Kingdom is a promise of restoration, where the current world will pass away and God will bring about a new heaven and earth. The Bible states “He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” The fact that God will one day wipe away every tear gives us hope. Our intention is not religious conversion, rather help them to know the almighty God and Jesus Christ.

(Mathew 24:14. Mark 16:15. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Acts 10: 34,35)

10\. Our Christian Responsibility

We have a sense of responsibility to preach the good news of the kingdom to all. We have a Christian duty to serve each other and encourage one another, to help them believe, overcome and stay faithful in a discouraging world. We need to promote love and harmony in the community. We need to love others as ourselves. This includes not only those who are easy to love, but also those who are difficult or different from us. As followers of Christ, we are called to show God’s love and compassion to all people, regardless of their background, religion, race, or social status. We should not speak or do anything which may harm others or create division in the society. We need to keep our mind and body clean, set a good example to others by keeping high moral standards. Our body is the temple of Holy spirit. God instructs us to honor Him with our body. Governments are ordained of God, and so Christians are called to respect whatever it is that God institutes and ordains. We need to support and help the government or other organizations in serving the society if needed, especially in case of calamities and disasters. It is our responsibility to support the needy ones and elderly people as Jesus told us.

Our Christian meetings serve as gatherings where believers come together to worship, study scripture, pray, and fellowship with one another. Hebrews 10:25 says, “And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.

Scripture study is central to Christian meetings, where passages from the Bible are read and discussed to deepen understanding and spiritual growth. Prayer is a vital component, providing an opportunity for individuals to communicate with God, seek guidance, and intercede for others. Fellowship fosters a sense of community and support, allowing believers to share their joys, struggles, and faith journeys with one another.

Overall, Christian meetings serve as essential gatherings where believers come together to express their devotion, strengthen their faith, and encourage one another in their walk with Christ.
